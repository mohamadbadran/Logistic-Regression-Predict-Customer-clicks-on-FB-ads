# Logistic-Regression-Predict-Customer-clicks-on-FB-ads
PROBLEM STATEMENT
You have been hired as a consultant to a start-up that is running a targetted marketing ads on facebook. The company wants to anaylze customer behaviour by predicting which customer clicks on the advertisement. Customer data is as follows:
Inputs:

.Name

.e-mail

.Country

.Time on Facebook

.Estimated Salary (derived from other parameters)

Outputs:

.Click (1: customer clicked on Ad, 0: Customer did not click on the Ad)

In this code we will train a model to predict whether the customer clicked on the advertisement or no.

We will walk through these steps :
1 - Import the libraries
2 - Import the dataset
3 - Counting some values
4 - Plotting some pictures to visualize some data points
5 - Prepare the data for training/ data cleaning
6 - Splitting the data into 80% training and 20% testing set
7 - Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set
8 - Model testing (predicting values)
9 - Making the Confusion Matrix
10- Visualizing training and testing datasets

NOTE : These datasets are fake.
